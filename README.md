# CORD-19 Dataset Project

## Justin Choi

Hi! Everything should be self explanatory in the notebook, but this was a super dope project to do on the CORD-19 dataset from AI2, so I hope you guys enjoy it too. Ultimately utilized k-means clustering, latent semantic analysis, t-SNE, and latent dirichlet allocation for modelling, and used NLTK, Pandas, Seaborn, and numpy + scikit-learn to carry out everything; if you have any questions as to what I did, just drop me a line at juicetin@seas.upenn.edu!!

(also if the ipynb notebook rendering starts acting up, try using [this](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/orangejuicetin/CORD-19_Analysis/blob/master/justin_choi_cis545_final.ipynb) nbviewer.jupyter link, and worst case I added in a html file too you can download to see the whole project as a webpage!)
